asciiart
========

Uses R to create ascii art from jpegs.  Just put in a url that points to a single jpeg, and you're off. 

It will print the ascii art in R, and return a matrix object into your R environment.  You can save that and impress family, friends and anonymous point-giving strangers on the interwebs. 

It requires the jpeg package for R.  

And the license is actually in the script.
